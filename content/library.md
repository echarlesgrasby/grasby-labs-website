This page is a list of books that I have in my personal library. This includes both books that I have in the bookcase in my office, alongside digital "e-books" that I own in various formats (my Kindle, PDFs, etc.). I decided to start maintaing a list of books that I own in an effort to foster a habit of reading regularly.

Ever since starting this list in 2020, I have read *considerably* more in my adult life than in years past.

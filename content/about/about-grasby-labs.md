## Questions You May *(Not)* Have

### Why 'Grasby Labs'

My name is Eric Grasby. I'm an American software engineer. I enjoy experimenting with different services in my spare time. Ergo, Grasby Labs seemed a fitting title for the umbrella of different hobbyist projects that I host online.

### What Tools Do You Use

See this article for the [Programs And Tools]({{< ref "/about/programs-and-tools.md" >}}) that I use, along with types of projects that I like to work on.

### What Are You Interested In?

I have varied interests; I don't really define myself by anything that I like (though I suppose that calling myself a "software engineer" is a typecast all its own). Some of my interests are below:
